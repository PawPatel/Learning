# Learning

This repository contains code from some of my various machine learning projects; both coursework and my own independent projects! The code does not represent complete projects. A lot of the code cannot be made publically available for publication reasons (you understand, right?). But, hopefully, some of it will demonstrate my familiarity with python.


Currently: 
Assignments from graduate level Machine Learning course

Upcoming: 
My code for the Winton Stock Market Challenge from kaggle (after the deadline passes). I will probably only post baselevel algorithms that can be easily repeated. Interested parties can email me about my own ideas that I implemented for time series prediction using ML (maybe...I will share. :-))
